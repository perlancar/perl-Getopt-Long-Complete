          with no_ignore_case, bundling.

        - bin/demo-getopt-long-complete: bug fix and add some more short/long
          option aliases.

        - Add note that the behaviour of completion assumes Getopt::Long is
          configured with these configuration: no_ignore_case, bundling,
          auto_abbrev, permute.


0.08    2014-07-27  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - bin/demo-getopt-long-complete: set sane Getopt::Long configuration

        - Support old GetOptionsWithCompletion()'s first argument as hash
          (through Complete::Getopt::Long 0.09). This is undocumented and will
          be removed in the future though.


0.06    2014-07-27  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - (Adjust with Complete::Getopt::Long) GetOptionsWithCompletion()'s
          first argument is now a coderef instead of hash of codes/arrays. This
          is conceptually simpler and does not force user to specify for every
          opt spec if she doesn't need to. The completion code now gets more
          information/arguments to be able to differentiate what option/argument
          it is being called for. See Complete::Getopt::Long for more details.
